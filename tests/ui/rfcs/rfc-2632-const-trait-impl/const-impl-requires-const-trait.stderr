error[E0207]: the const parameter `host` is not constrained by the impl trait, self type, or predicates

   = note: to constrain `host`, use it in the implemented trait, in the self type, or in an equality with an associated type
   = note: expressions using a const parameter must map each value to a distinct output value
   = note: proving the result of expressions other than the parameter are unique is not supported
